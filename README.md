This is a rock, paper, scissor game. There is a story behind it when
Chihiro Ogino from spirit away met "No face". "No face" is really lonely
and he has no one to play with, so Chihiro plays rock, paper, scissor 
with him/her when they are on the train to see Yubaba where she lives 
inside the forrest. The background is a forrest thats what they see 
outside of the train. 

The game itself is really simple as the logic is really simple, 
what I found challenge is that when I am putting all the little parts 
together and get it to work. 

I found it very happy to be able to add different animations on the page. I 
I made the rain to 45 degree,because I felt the 45 degree rain make the 
rain looks stronger. When we are living in california, there is no rain 
thats why I want a heavy rain fall. And I also put "play with me" at the
 background,because "no name" really want someone to play with him. 

The beginnging animation is call rubberband, it is like when they are 
sitting down. When someone lose, I made it shake, its like  "nono". 
But if you win, you got a flashing win. I also made the rock, paper, 
scissor drop down from the top when player picked a card, because I felt 
like it make you think that you  are actually playing the game in person. 
I also add the theme song of spirited away as the background music I set 
it to auto play, becuase I really like the music and I really hope people
can finish listening the whole song.
